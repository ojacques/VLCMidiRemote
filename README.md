# VLC Midi Remote
VLC Midi remote is a small Windows utility to control VLC Media Player with MIDI commands.
One use case is to play items in a VLC playlist using MIDI messages.

MIDI can be wired or wireless, using the awesome [rtpMIDI project](http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/rtpmidi.html).
